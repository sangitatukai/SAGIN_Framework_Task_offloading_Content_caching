## ✅ SAGIN PPO Framework: Code Overview & Execution Guide

This project simulates a **Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN)** for task offloading and caching with multiple UAVs, IoT regions, and satellites. Each UAV learns its policy independently using **PPO with GRU**.

## 📁 **File structure & descriptions:**

```
.
├── main.py                  # Main simulation entry point (RUN THIS)
├── sagin_env.py             # Environment class managing UAVs, IoTRegions, Satellites
├── uav.py                   # UAV class with caching, aggregation, popularity prediction (GRU)
├── iot_region.py            # IoTRegion class with IoT device activation pattern predictor (GRU)
├── satellite.py              # Satellite class with coverage & storage logic

```

## 📝 **Key components:**

- **main.py** → Entry point to initialize the environment and agents, run simulation loop, train PPO.
- **sagin_env.py** → Coordinates all UAVs, IoTRegions, and Satellites each timestep.
- **uav.py** → Defines UAV state, caching, task queue, popularity predictor (GRU for content popularity).
- **iot_region.py** → Defines each region’s IoT activation predictor (GRU model per region) + content generation.
- **satellite.py** → Defines satellite coverage + caching mechanism.
- **agent/uav_agent.py** → PPO agent implementation with neural network.

---

## 🚀 **How to execute:**

1. Make sure **Python 3.7+** is installed.
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install torch numpy
   ```
3. Save all files in the folder structure shown above.
4. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This will execute **5 epochs of simulation**, printing outputs per epoch.

---

## ✨ **What happens during execution:**
- Each region’s IoTRegion predicts active IoT devices → generates content.
- UAV aggregates content → decides what to cache locally vs send to satellite.
- UAV receives task requests → uses PPO to decide offloading destination.
- PPO agent updates every 2 epochs.

---

## 📌 **Next steps / extensibility:**
✅ Add more realistic task models (CPU, delay constraints).  
✅ Extend PPO to jointly optimize caching + task offloading.  
✅ Add evaluation metrics, plotting, logging.

Feel free to ask if you'd like to extend functionality or need debugging support!
