# SAGIN:  Content Caching and Task Offloading Framework in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks

This project implements a **Deep Reinforcement Learning-based framework** for **joint content caching and task offloading** in **SAGIN (Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network)** environments. It simulates UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), satellites, and ground-based IoT devices collaborating for efficient data processing, content caching, and task execution under resource constraints.

- **IoT Devices** generate content and tasks.
- **UAVs** aggregate, cache, and process tasks or offload them to neighbors or satellites.
- **Satellites** act as powerful compute/cache nodes with global coverage.

## üîÑ Simulation Flow

1. **IoT Device Activation**  
   At each time step, IoT devices generate content based on Zipf-distributed popularity.

2. **UAV Aggregation**  
   UAVs receive content, transmit to satellites (if connected), and consume energy.

3. **OFDM Slot Allocation**  
   UAVs get randomly assigned slots to communicate with satellites.

4. **Satellite Caching**  
   Satellites receive and store content with TTL constraints.

5. **Task Generation**  
   UAVs generate computational tasks that need associated content.

6. **Offloading Decisions**  
   - First try local cache  
   - Then neighbor UAVs  
   - Then satellite  
   - If not found, task is dropped

7. **Task Execution**  
   UAVs and satellites execute queued tasks if delays are within bounds.

8. **Caching Decision via PPO**  
   A GRU-based PPO agent decides which content to cache in UAVs based on observed energy, content popularity, neighbor loads, etc.

9. **Eviction & Energy Update**  
   Expired content is evicted. UAV energy is updated and checked‚Äîsimulation halts if any UAV's energy is depleted.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### A. Baseline Policy (no RL):
```bash
python compare_policies.py
```
This runs the simulation using:
- Popularity-based caching
- Greedy offloading
- 5 episodes of 5 time slots each

### B. PPO Policy (learning-based):
```bash
python main.py
```
This:
- Loads a PPO+GRU agent
- Executes 500 time slots
- Learns caching decisions per UAV

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib

Install with:
```bash
pip install numpy torch matplotlib
```

---

## üìä Output

- Task logs and success summaries printed after each run
- Cache hit rates and delay-bound statistics per UAV
- Optional plots in `compare_policies.py`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- The simulation stops **immediately** if **any UAV's energy becomes zero**, simulating real-world failure.
- Satellites have **universal coverage**; they do not move.
- UAVs cache content within limited memory and update their cache per time slot.
- Content and tasks have TTLs and delay bounds.

---

## üß† Future Extensions

- Multi-agent PPO
- Federated caching across UAVs
- Energy-aware path planning for UAV movement
- Satellite handovers and mobility
